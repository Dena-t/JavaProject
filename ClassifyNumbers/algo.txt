Project 1 ClassifyNumbers

 
 
The program reads 20 integers, but you can easily modify it to read any set of numbers. In fact, 
you can modify the program so that it first prompts the user to specify how many integers are to 
be read. 
 
Input: A 20 integersâ€”positive, negative, or zeros.  
Output: The number of zeros, even numbers, and odd numbers.

Step by step algorithm


This program reads a given set of integers and then prints the number of odd integers, the 
number of even integers, and the number of zeros.

This program can read 20 integers or any set of numbers

Do you want it to read the preset 20 numbers? Y/N

    
if no then ask:
    

    How many numbers do you want it to classify?
    prompt to enter number

    do you want these numbers to be randomly generated? Y/N
    
        if Yes then generate the entered quantity of random numbers

        if no then prompt to enter the numbers manually separated by a space


if yes then read  0 -2 -3 -5 6 7 8 0 3 0 -23 -8 0 2 9 0 12 67 54 

    Store value in the variable
    Check if number is = 0
        if number = 0 increment 0 count
    Check if number is even or odd
        Divide number by 2
            Check reminder
                if reminder = 0 then number is even
                    if number is even, increment even count
                if reminder is = 1 then number is odd
                    if number is odd, increment odd count
    

Variables
    integer numbers

        integer zeros
        integer evens
        integer odds
    
(integer counts)

        integer zeros count
        integer evens count
        integer odds count
